# iOS Agent Harness Specification

**Status:** Dynamic Workflows implementation and consolidated audit remediation complete; physical-device release matrix pending

**Date:** 2026-08-09

**Scope:** Full-featured iOS agent harness, local-first with optional online providers

**Out of scope:** the private Agent Sandbox Runtime implementation, visual graph editing, and remote/cross-device execution

## 1. Executive summary

mobileLLM is evolving from an in-process chat tool loop into a durable, policy-driven iOS agent runtime.
The current release includes a complete root-agent harness, bounded child runs, staged workflows, and the P0
Claude-style Dynamic Workflows runtime specified in §34. It must reliably execute
multi-step model and tool interactions, request user input and approval, survive interruption, manage local-model
resources, preserve a complete operational record, and remain responsive in the existing unified chat UI.

The current release is local-first, supports explicitly configured online providers, and retains the iOS 17 target.
Local and online providers share run semantics. The runtime implements bounded subagents and reserves a seam
for a separately developed, commercial Agent Sandbox Runtime, without linking or imitating that
private runtime today.

iOS is the product and acceptance scope. Because the repository shares packages and `ChatStore` with macOS, the
MLX-free runtime must continue to compile on macOS and existing Mac chat behavior must not regress; Mac-specific agent
features and sandbox integration are not part of this release.

The staged workflow orchestrator and Dynamic Workflows runtime both coordinate bounded instances of the same
`AgentExecutor`. The former remains a compatibility path; the latter executes analyzed, approved JavaScript
orchestration scripts and does not expose a static DAG authoring model.

## 2. Frozen product decisions

The following decisions are requirements, not open questions:

1. The release is local-first and may use explicitly configured online providers. Provider APIs remain neutral;
   there is no silent local-to-online fallback and every online request uses the same authorization boundary.
2. The app retains its iOS 17 minimum deployment target.
3. Tool choices persist per conversation. The runtime intelligently narrows the user-allowed set for each model
   pass, but it never enables a tool the user did not allow.
4. External access always requires authorization; Ask presents approval while Safe preset/Full access may bind it
   automatically within the frozen ceiling. Tool selection and operation authorization remain separate decisions.
5. One root agent actively progresses at a time; bounded durable children receive strictly attenuated authority
   and budgets. Recursive self-delegation and unbounded agent teams are prohibited.
6. Chat and agent execution share one UI. Simple answers remain visually simple; execution detail is progressively
   disclosed when a run performs work.
7. The open-source target exposes a versioned Agent Sandbox API but includes no sandbox implementation. A future
   private module may supply that implementation through dependency injection.
8. A bounded staged workflow orchestrator remains for compatibility. Full Dynamic Workflows use the Claude-style
   JavaScript ABI in §34, saved immutable versions, durable replay, and one fair parallel-subagent scheduler.
9. App launch must not load a model, reopen the previous conversation, or silently resume a suspended run. Pending
   runs are discoverable and resume only through explicit user intent, except for an already-authorized operating
   system continued-processing task that is still active.
10. Implementation is followed by one consolidated independent audit. Development uses continuous automated tests,
    but must not devolve into an unbounded implement-audit-reimplement loop.
11. Across the app, at most one root run actively progresses at a time. Other runs may remain durably paused or
    waiting without owning model or tool-execution resources.
12. Every boundary-crossing operation uses an enforceable `prepare -> authorize -> execute` transaction. Approval
    covers the prepared operation, not merely a tool name or model-generated preview.

## 3. Goals

### 3.1 Complete iOS agent behavior

The harness must support:

- zero-tool answers without an additional planning or routing model pass;
- multi-step model -> tool -> model execution;
- one or more tool calls returned by a model pass;
- typed action validation and one bounded repair attempt for malformed structured output;
- explicit requests for additional user input;
- external-access approval and durable approval receipts;
- pause, resume, and cancellation at well-defined boundaries;
- deterministic recovery after app suspension, termination, or process crash;
- bounded retries, deadlines, duplicate suppression, and no-progress detection;
- durable artifacts for images, documents, web content, structured data, and large tool results;
- existing Memory, Skills, MCP, vision, and conversation features;
- coherent context budgeting across conversation, memory, skills, tools, run state, and artifacts;
- thermal, memory, time, token, tool-call, network, and output budgets;
- inspectable operational events without persisting hidden chain-of-thought;
- clear terminal and nonterminal status in the existing chat experience;
- testability without loading real model weights, plus real-device evaluation with supported local models.

### 3.2 Future compatibility

The architecture must allow later additions of:

- additional online provider protocols, routing, and cost policy;
- nested and remotely scheduled workflow-managed subagents beyond the shipped bounded local scheduler;
- the private Agent Sandbox Runtime;
- alternate isolated Dynamic Workflows providers, including the future private Agent Sandbox Runtime;
- remote or cross-device scheduling without changing saved scripts or durable run semantics.

Future compatibility means stable contracts and identifiers. Section 34 turns that compatibility into a committed,
test-gated P0 program rather than an indefinite placeholder.

## 4. Non-goals

The current release must not implement:

- a Python/WASM/arbitrary-code workflow runtime, static DAG authoring model, or visual workflow editor;
- direct filesystem, shell, network, secret, tool, or sandbox authority inside a workflow script;
- recursive delegation, unbounded agent teams, or child-created approval authority;
- parallel local-model decoding presented as parallel agents;
- silent cloud fallback or online requests outside the prepared authorization boundary;
- the commercial Agent Sandbox Runtime or a production substitute for it;
- arbitrary shell, process, or unrestricted filesystem access;
- cross-device task distribution or synchronization;
- KV-cache serialization as a recovery mechanism;
- an embeddings or vector database unless measurement proves the simpler context selector inadequate;
- automatic re-entry into the last conversation or automatic model loading at launch.

## 5. Current architecture and migration constraints

The existing system has valuable components that must be preserved:

- `LLMEngine` provides engine-independent streaming reasoning, answer, and completion events.
- `RoutingEngine` keeps at most one local engine resident, which is a hard memory-safety invariant.
- `GenerationLifecycle` and `GenerationGovernance` provide cooperative cancellation, pause, thermal governance, and
  safe model load/unload draining.
- `ToolDialect`, `ToolCallProcessor`, and `ToolLoop` provide tolerant parsing, duplicate suppression, bounded tool
  execution, untrusted-result framing, and a tool-free final synthesis pass.
- `ToolRegistry` supports built-in tools and remote MCP tools selected by the user.
- `ConversationStore`, `DurableStore`, `MemoryStore`, and attachment persistence already establish defensive local
  storage patterns.

The migration must address these limitations:

- `ChatStore.startGeneration` currently owns UI state, context construction, memory injection, tool assembly,
  execution, recovery, and persistence.
- `ToolLoop` holds its run state only in local variables and cannot resume after process loss.
- `Tool.execute(argumentsJSON:) -> String` cannot express typed errors, progress, effects, approvals, deadlines,
  artifacts, or idempotency.
- the current schema model loses nested JSON Schema structure, especially for MCP tools;
- conversation persistence stores only the final message and a flattened tool history, not an execution journal;
- app backgrounding currently unloads the resident model without a durable agent checkpoint protocol.

The migration must preserve current user data and ordinary chat behavior. It must not require a destructive
conversation migration.

## 6. Target package boundaries

The implementation should introduce three small MLX-free packages and keep platform implementations injectable.

### 6.1 `AgentContracts`

Owns the minimal versioned value vocabulary shared across runtime, sandbox API, and future execution clients:

- strongly typed run, step, request, artifact, event-cursor, and execution-handle identifiers;
- versioned request/result/event envelopes;
- run capability ceilings, step grants, budgets, command envelopes, and redaction metadata;
- immutable `ExternalOperationPlan` and authorization-bound request envelopes;
- provider-neutral artifact references and typed failure classifications.

It contains no scheduler, persistence implementation, UI, model engine, tool implementation, or sandbox behavior.
This package prevents a dependency cycle between `AgentRuntime` and `AgentSandboxAPI` while keeping the private
sandbox implementation independent.

### 6.2 `AgentRuntime`

Owns public agent semantics and runtime coordination:

- `AgentExecutor`
- `AgentRunController`
- `AgentRunStateMachine`
- `ContextCompiler`
- `AgentModelProvider` and model capability types
- `ToolV2`, `ToolCatalog`, `ToolSelector`, and `ToolExecutor`
- `ApprovalPolicyEngine`
- `ResourceArbiter`
- `RunJournal` protocol and projections
- artifact references and budgets
- lifecycle event definitions

It depends on `AgentContracts` and may depend on `LLMCore`, `AppRuntime`, and the protocol-only `AgentSandboxAPI`, but
not SwiftUI, MobileLLMUI, MLX, llama.cpp, EventKit, CoreLocation, or the future private sandbox implementation.

### 6.3 `AgentSandboxAPI`

Owns only versioned, implementation-neutral sandbox contracts. It may depend on `AgentContracts`; it must not depend
on `AgentRuntime`, SwiftUI, a model engine, or a concrete sandbox.

### 6.4 Existing packages

- `MobileLLMUI` sends runtime commands and renders runtime projections. It does not implement orchestration.
- `LLMCore` continues to own model, catalog, dialect, and existing tool-domain primitives during migration.
- platform tools remain in their appropriate package and adapt to `ToolV2`.
- concrete local engines remain unchanged behind model-provider adapters unless capability negotiation requires a
  narrowly scoped protocol extension.

## 7. Core terminology and identity

- **Conversation:** persistent user-visible chat history and per-conversation preferences.
- **Agent run:** execution initiated by one user turn or an explicit resume action.
- **Step:** one stable execution boundary, such as context compilation, a model attempt, an approval, a tool
  invocation, or finalization.
- **Attempt:** one try of a retryable step.
- **Invocation:** one normalized call to one tool.
- **Artifact:** durable content referenced by metadata rather than embedded in run events.
- **Run capability ceiling:** immutable maximum authority frozen for a run.
- **Step capability grant:** immutable subset of the run ceiling available to one step.
- **Approval receipt:** durable evidence that the user approved a bounded action or action class.
- **Projection:** UI-oriented state derived from journal events.

All durable entities use stable opaque identifiers from `AgentContracts`. At minimum:

```swift
struct AgentRunID: Hashable, Codable, Sendable
struct AgentStepID: Hashable, Codable, Sendable
struct ToolInvocationID: Hashable, Codable, Sendable
struct ApprovalID: Hashable, Codable, Sendable
struct ArtifactID: Hashable, Codable, Sendable
```

Raw UUID strings must not be used interchangeably across entity types.

## 8. Run lifecycle and state machine

One accepted user send creates one `AgentRun`. The run snapshots all execution-defining inputs before the first model
pass:

- conversation and user-turn identifiers;
- model, variant, provider, and capability versions;
- sampling and context limits;
- active system-prompt and Skill versions;
- relevant Memory record identifiers;
- user-allowed and runtime-advertised tool sets;
- exact tool descriptor IDs, including schema and trust revisions;
- run capability ceiling and approval policy version;
- budgets and lifecycle policy.

Before each model attempt, `ContextCompiler` commits an immutable `CompiledRequestManifest`. It records exact source
revisions or content hashes, selected and truncated ranges, rendered prompt hash, serialized advertised tool schemas
and hashes, artifact excerpt hashes, tokenizer or estimator identity, and policy versions. Sensitive bodies may live
in a protected artifact referenced by hash. Recovery reuses this manifest; it does not reread mutable Memory, Skill,
or conversation records and then claim the request is unchanged.

Required states:

```text
created
preparing
waitingForModel
generating
validatingAction
waitingForApproval
executingTools
waitingForUser
synthesizing
pausing
paused
waitingForForeground
waitingForReconciliation
completed
failed
cancelled
```

Every transition is validated by a pure state machine and recorded before its projection is shown as committed UI.
Invalid transitions fail closed and produce a diagnostic event; they must never be silently coerced.

`waitingForUser` is backed by a durable `InteractionRequestRecord` containing a stable request ID, prompt, optional
response schema, creation state version, disposition, and eventual response. Responses carry the request ID and
expected run-state version; duplicate responses are idempotent and stale responses fail closed.

`waitingForReconciliation` is nonterminal. It represents a boundary-crossing action whose outcome cannot be proven.
The run cannot replay that action or continue past it until the user or a tool-provided reconciliation operation marks
it succeeded, failed, or abandoned. Only an explicit decision to abandon unresolved work terminates the run with
`externalResultUncertain`.

The runtime may execute a bounded batch of independent proposed tool calls concurrently. Each invocation has
its own state machine (`proposed`, `prepared`, `waitingForApproval`, `authorized`, `executing`, `completed`, `failed`,
`waitingForReconciliation`, `cancelled`). A deterministic barrier appends results in proposal order and starts the
next model pass only after every invocation in the batch reaches a usable outcome. Parallel tool batches are the
second step of the multi-agent roadmap (§30): bounded fan-out executes under the SAME run ceiling, budget ledger,
duplicate suppression, and reconciliation invariants as serial batches. They land after the subagent spawner and
before the staged workflow orchestrator.

### 8.1 Stable boundaries

Durable checkpoints occur after:

- run-input snapshot creation;
- context compilation;
- a completed model attempt;
- normalized action validation;
- approval grant or denial;
- tool intent recording;
- tool outcome recording;
- artifact commit;
- final answer commit;
- pause, cancellation, or failure finalization.

Token-by-token output is not a stable recovery boundary. The UI may receive ephemeral token events, and the runtime
may persist a rate-limited incomplete draft for user visibility. After interruption, an incomplete model attempt is
discarded as authoritative state and restarted from the preceding stable boundary.

### 8.2 Terminal semantics

A run terminates with exactly one reason:

```text
completed
cancelledByUser
budgetExceeded
noProgress
permissionDenied
toolUnavailable
modelUnavailable
contextUnsatisfiable
externalResultUncertain
internalFailure
```

Nonterminal waits (`waitingForApproval`, `waitingForUser`, `waitingForForeground`, `waitingForReconciliation`, and
`paused`) remain resumable. Background expiration normally transitions to `waitingForForeground`; it is not itself a
terminal failure.

## 9. Persistence and recovery

### 9.1 Source of truth

The agent runtime uses a transactional SQLite journal. WAL mode, schema migrations, foreign-key enforcement, and
transactional event sequence allocation are required. The specific Swift SQLite binding is an implementation choice
behind an internal storage adapter; storage semantics must not leak into the runtime APIs.

The journal is append-only for the lifetime of retained execution facts. "Append-only" does not override user
deletion: privacy deletion removes the complete retained run and its owned data.

For every new AgentRuntime turn, the journal is the canonical source for accepted user-turn payload, run lifecycle,
and committed assistant result. Conversation JSON remains a backward-compatible user-visible projection during
migration, not a second authority for those new messages.

A durable outbox in the same SQLite transaction as each canonical message/run event contains an idempotent projection
command keyed by stable `MessageID` and `RunID`. The projector applies that command to `ConversationStore`, then
records its acknowledgement. A crash before or during the JSON write replays the unacknowledged command; an already
applied command is a no-op. The JSON store must never create a new-runtime message that lacks a corresponding
canonical journal event.

Send acceptance uses this order:

1. atomically commit required attachment artifacts;
2. transactionally record the accepted user message, `RunCreated`, and projection outbox command;
3. clear the composer and begin execution only after that transaction succeeds;
4. project to Conversation JSON idempotently.

Finalization transactionally records the final answer and its projection command before UI treats the answer as
committed. If projection lags, the runtime projection supplies the visible state and recovery reconciles JSON. This
ordering prevents ghost answers, duplicate messages, and executed-but-invisible tool turns.

### 9.2 Minimum records

- `AgentRunRecord`
- `AgentStepRecord`
- `RunEventRecord(sequence, payloadVersion)`
- `ModelAttemptRecord`
- `CompiledRequestManifestRecord`
- `ToolInvocationRecord`
- `ApprovalRecord`
- `InteractionRequestRecord`
- `ArtifactRecord`
- `UsageLedgerRecord`
- `ProjectionOutboxRecord`

Every record format is versioned. Migrations are forward-only, transactional, and tested against production-like
fixtures. A migration failure preserves the original database and blocks mutation with a recoverable error.

### 9.3 Concurrency and command consistency

Each run has a monotonically increasing state version and event sequence; every event also has a globally unique ID.
State-changing commands use a SQLite compare-and-swap transaction equivalent to
`append(runID, expectedRunVersion, commandID, events)`. Exactly one competing approval, cancellation, background
expiration, tool callback, or model callback may advance a given version. Duplicate command IDs and duplicate outcome
IDs return the original receipt without appending new events. A database uniqueness constraint permits at most one
terminal event per run.

All user and lifecycle commands carry `RunID`, stable request or command ID, and `expectedRunVersion`. Stale commands
fail closed with current-state information; UI destruction or stream cancellation never implies a run command.

### 9.4 Recovery algorithm

On explicit resume:

1. Load the latest materialized projection and replay later events.
2. Verify the pinned model, prompt, Skill, tool schemas, and run capability ceiling are still available.
3. Classify the interrupted step as replayable, completed, uncertain, or incompatible.
4. Reuse completed artifacts and idempotent outcomes.
5. Restart an interrupted model attempt from its preceding stable boundary.
6. Never automatically replay a non-idempotent external action whose outcome is unknown.
7. Require user choice to migrate or restart when a pinned dependency is incompatible.
8. Replay unacknowledged ConversationStore projection commands and reconcile by stable message ID.

Opening the app lists recoverable runs but does not select their conversation, load their model, or resume them.

### 9.5 Deletion coordination

Deleting an active conversation first blocks new commands and quiesces its run. A deletion intent is committed to the
journal before cross-store removal. Soft delete retains run data only for the existing undo interval. Hard delete
removes conversation projections, run/step/model/tool/interaction events, approval receipts, security-scoped
bookmarks, artifacts with no remaining owner, projection outbox entries, snapshots, migration backups, and bounded
diagnostics for that conversation. Recovery replays an incomplete deletion intent until every owned store agrees.

`Delete All` first atomically writes a non-sensitive, protected, backup-excluded marker at
`<conversation-directory>.erase-pending`, owned by the app-level erase coordinator and outside every
database/artifact/conversation directory being removed. On launch, that marker blocks all store opening and mutation
until deletion finishes. The operation
then closes the database, removes the database together with `-wal` and `-shm`, conversation projections, artifacts,
bookmarks, backups, and diagnostics, creates clean stores, and removes the marker last. A crash at any point re-enters
deletion from the marker. SQLite uses secure deletion and a truncate checkpoint before ordinary row-level purges where
possible, but the product does not claim forensic physical erasure from flash media; protection relies additionally
on platform encryption and key destruction.

## 10. Model-provider abstraction

The first implementation adapts the current local `LLMEngine` into `AgentModelProvider`.

```swift
protocol AgentModelProvider: Sendable {
    var descriptor: AgentModelProviderDescriptor { get }
    func capabilities(for model: AgentModelSelection) async -> AgentModelCapabilities
    func prepare(
        _ request: AgentModelRequest,
        context: ModelPreparationContext
    ) async throws -> PreparedModelRequest
    func generate(
        _ request: AuthorizedModelRequest
    ) -> AsyncThrowingStream<AgentModelEvent, Error>
}
```

`capabilities(for:)` and `prepare` may read only local registered or cached metadata; they perform no network or
private-data access. A future capability refresh is itself a separately prepared external operation.

`PreparedModelRequest` contains the immutable compiled-request manifest plus an `ExternalOperationPlan`. A local
provider produces a `localPure` plan with no approval requirement. A future online provider's plan declares its exact
endpoint and redirect bounds, provider/model, prompt and artifact data categories or payload digests, maximum request
and response bytes, retention-policy metadata, and credential reference. Only `ApprovalPolicyEngine` can construct
`AuthorizedModelRequest`, binding authorization to the plan hash. `generate` may transmit or process only that bound
request; any expansion requires a new plan and approval. This makes online-provider support an additive adapter rather
than a future breaking change to the provider contract.

Capabilities include:

- context and output limits;
- text-dialect versus native structured tool calling;
- JSON-schema or grammar-constrained output support;
- reasoning and vision support;
- multiple-tool-call support;
- cancellation granularity;
- provider concurrency and residency constraints;
- usage and cost reporting fields, even when local cost is zero.

The runtime consumes normalized events only:

```text
reasoningDelta
answerDelta
toolCalls
requestUserInput
usage
completed
failed
```

A provider stream emits no events after a terminal event. Successful completion contains exactly one terminal
`completed` event; a thrown transport or runtime error before that event is converted by `AgentRuntime` into one
durable failed attempt. Cancelling an attempt stream cancels only that model attempt, not the owning run. Mixed prose
and tool syntax is normalized to one action: prose emitted before `callTools` remains provisional and is discarded
from the final answer; an action cannot simultaneously be final text and a tool batch.

Token accounting uses the provider's tokenizer when available. Otherwise it uses a named, versioned conservative
estimator with a safety margin. "Deterministic recovery" means deterministic replay of recorded facts and compiled
request manifests; rerunning stochastic inference is not promised to reproduce identical text.

Tool dialect parsing is an adapter concern. The run state machine does not contain model-family conditionals.

Provider and model selection are pinned for the run. The first release must never fall back from a local model to an
online provider. A future online provider requires explicit setup, Keychain-backed credentials, provider-specific
data-egress consent, and a visible run snapshot of what may leave the device.

## 11. Single-model resource arbitration

The current invariant of at most one resident local engine remains authoritative.

`ResourceArbiter` grants a model lease before generation and coordinates:

- model loading and unloading;
- one active local decode lane;
- cancellation and draining before residency changes;
- foreground/background transitions;
- thermal and memory-pressure policy;
- expensive model switching;
- future independent provider lanes.

Bounded independent tool calls may execute concurrently, but multiple local decodes are never presented as physically
parallel on iPhone. Future versions may add logically concurrent subagents, but every
local model pass remains queued through the single decode lane.

Across the app, only one root run may own the actively progressing execution slot. Waiting, paused, and reconciliation
runs own no model lease and may coexist durably. Starting or resuming another run either queues it or requires an
explicit user switch; it never silently preempts the current owner. Approving or responding to a waiting older run
makes that run eligible to continue but does not steal the slot from a newer owner.

Pause is durable quiescence, not indefinite suspension of an async task or resident multi-gigabyte model. It cancels
an unfinished model attempt at a stable boundary, records it as interrupted, releases the decode lease, and unloads
according to residency policy. Pause or Stop requested after a non-idempotent external write enters its noncancellable
critical section records a durable `pauseRequested` or `cancelRequested` command intent on that invocation; the
runtime waits for a confirmed outcome or moves to `waitingForReconciliation` before releasing ownership.

## 12. Agent action protocol and loop policy

Every model pass resolves to one normalized action:

```swift
enum AgentAction {
    case callTools([ProposedToolCall])
    case requestUserInput(UserInputRequest)
    case finalAnswer(AgentAnswer)
}
```

The runtime validates tool names, full schemas, argument sizes, capabilities, approval requirements, and budgets
before execution. A malformed structured action receives at most one bounded, non-thinking repair pass. Failure of
that repair ends the run with a precise user-visible error.

No mandatory planner pass is added to ordinary conversation. Complex behavior emerges from successive bounded
actions. This protects first-token latency and avoids asking small local models to create plans they cannot reliably
execute.

All calls in a proposed batch are normalized and authorized before execution, then use a bounded deterministic barrier.
A denied, failed, or uncertain invocation stops the remaining batch unless the failure is explicitly typed as a safe,
nonessential miss by local trusted policy. The model and a remote descriptor cannot decide that classification.

Budgets are fixed by tested local policy rather than by the model. They cover:

- model-pass budget;
- tool-invocation budget;
- structured-repair budget;
- repeated-call budget;
- wall-clock deadline;
- token and context budgets;
- network-input and network-output budgets;
- artifact and persisted-output limits;
- thermal and memory policy.

The first-release default hard limits are six model attempts, three completed tool invocations, one structured repair,
one execution per identical normalized call fingerprint, two consecutive no-progress actions, and fifteen minutes of
active run time. Approval, user-input, paused, reconciliation, and foreground waits do not consume active-run time.
Default network limits are 2 MiB per response and 8 MiB per run; default newly generated artifact data is limited to
32 MiB per run, excluding already accepted user attachments. A trusted tool may declare a lower limit, never a higher
one without a user-visible policy change.

Before a model attempt or tool invocation starts, the usage ledger atomically reserves its maximum call count and
declared token, byte, and time allowance. Unused reservation is returned at the stable outcome boundary. Work does
not begin when the remaining hard budget cannot cover its reservation.

The model cannot increase budgets. Repeated normalized calls and two consecutive no-progress actions terminate the
run. There is no unbounded implementation-review loop.

## 13. Tool V2 contract

### 13.1 Descriptor

Every tool has a stable namespaced identity and complete descriptor:

```swift
struct AgentToolLogicalID {
    var providerID: String
    var name: String
}

struct AgentToolDescriptorID {
    var logicalID: AgentToolLogicalID
    var version: String
    var schemaHash: String
    var trustRevision: String
}

struct AgentToolDescriptor {
    var id: AgentToolDescriptorID
    var title: String
    var summary: String
    var inputSchema: JSONSchema
    var outputSchema: JSONSchema?
    var effects: Set<ToolEffect>
    var requiredCapabilities: Set<AgentCapability>
    var timeoutPolicy: ToolTimeoutPolicy
    var retryPolicy: ToolRetryPolicy
    var idempotency: ToolIdempotency
    var supportsProgress: Bool
    var supportsCancellation: Bool
}
```

Schemas use JSON Schema Draft 2020-12. The local validator supports bounded object, array, scalar, `enum`, `const`,
`required`, `additionalProperties`, numeric/string/array bounds, composition, and local `$defs` references. Remote
references are forbidden. Encoded schemas are limited to 64 KiB, nesting depth 16, 1,024 resolved nodes, local
reference depth 16, and pattern length 256. Unsupported or unknown keywords are preserved for round-trip and display
but marked unenforced; they never silently pass as locally validated. A partially validated remote tool receives the
conservative external-effect and approval policy.

JSON arguments are normalized with RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme semantics after schema validation. Exact
descriptor ID, normalized arguments, and effect scope all participate in invocation and approval fingerprints.

### 13.2 Execution

```swift
protocol ToolV2: Sendable {
    var descriptor: AgentToolDescriptor { get }
    func prepare(
        request: ToolExecutionRequest,
        context: ToolPreparationContext
    ) async throws -> PreparedToolInvocation
    func execute(
        prepared: AuthorizedToolInvocation,
        context: ToolExecutionContext
    ) -> AsyncThrowingStream<ToolExecutionEvent, Error>
}
```

`prepare` is side-effect free and may not cross a filesystem, private-data, network, model-provider, or sandbox
boundary. It returns an immutable plan containing canonical arguments; concrete destinations and bounded redirect or
fallback rules; data categories or payload digest; maximum possible effects; timeout, retry, and idempotency semantics;
and the exact user preview. Local-pure tools return a plan with no external operations.

`ApprovalPolicyEngine` authorizes the immutable plan, producing `AuthorizedToolInvocation`. `execute` may perform only
the authorized plan. A redirect, fallback, resolved destination, payload, argument, or effect expansion outside that
plan stops execution and requires a new prepare/approval transaction. Runtime-observed behavior that is narrower than
the plan is allowed and recorded.

The execution context includes run, step, and invocation IDs; plan and schema hashes; deadline; cancellation;
idempotency key; step capability grant; approval receipt; artifact writer; secret references; and redacted logger. A
tool stream has exactly one terminal outcome and no later events.

Results support text, structured JSON, image, resource links, and artifact references. Errors are typed and classify
retryability, uncertainty, user action, and whether any external effect may have occurred.

Existing tools are migrated through a V1 adapter. The adapter may conservatively declare limited capabilities, but
it must not fabricate idempotency or cancellation guarantees.

Remote descriptors are untrusted metadata. MCP servers cannot lower their locally assigned effect, retry, approval,
or idempotency classification. An MCP tool without a trusted local mapping is `unknownExternal`: exact approval is
required for every invocation, automatic retry is forbidden, and transport loss after intent becomes
`waitingForReconciliation`.

MCP `initialize`, `tools/list`, capability refresh, and future resource/prompt discovery are external reads. They may
run only from explicit server setup, refresh, or an already authorized bounded server session; they must never occur
silently during prompt compilation. Server identity is a stable random ID rather than its mutable URL.

## 14. Conversation-persistent intelligent tool selection

Tool availability has three independent layers:

1. **Allowed set:** explicitly selected by the user and persisted on the conversation.
2. **Advertised set:** the relevant subset selected by the runtime for one model pass.
3. **Approved invocation:** permission to perform one external action or a narrowly scoped class of actions.

Each conversation persists a versioned policy:

```swift
struct ConversationToolPolicy: Codable, Sendable {
    var masterEnabled: Bool
    var allowedToolIDs: Set<AgentToolLogicalID>
    var pinnedToolIDs: Set<AgentToolLogicalID>
    var selectionPolicyVersion: Int
    var materializedFromGlobalTemplate: Bool
}
```

A new conversation copies the current global tool template once at creation. A legacy conversation with no policy
materializes the current global template exactly once, on its first edit or first new AgentRuntime run, then persists
the marker. Later global changes affect new conversations only unless the user explicitly applies them to an existing
conversation or all conversations. Every run then freezes the conversation policy it actually used.

Conversation policy stores logical IDs so user intent survives compatible upgrades. Each run resolves and snapshots
exact descriptor IDs. If a tool disappears, its trusted effect mapping changes, or its schema changes incompatibly,
the conversation keeps the user's logical selection but the run marks the tool unavailable and requires inspection
or renewed approval; it must not silently inherit an old receipt.

The selector:

- operates only inside the allowed set;
- honors user-pinned tools;
- filters unavailable capabilities and records why a tool is unavailable;
- ranks by the latest request, attachment types, active Skill, recent successful tool chain, and deterministic
  metadata;
- does not add another model inference pass;
- advertises a small configurable set appropriate for local 2B-8B models;
- includes an explicitly named allowed tool even if ranking would otherwise omit it;
- records its input, output, policy version, and rationale codes for testing and inspection.

The selector chooses what the model may consider. It does not invoke tools and does not bypass approval. If a user
asks for a capability that is not allowed, the app offers a visible enable action instead of silently running it.

## 15. Capability and approval model

### 15.1 Effect classes

At minimum:

```text
localPure
localRead
localWrite
privateDataRead
networkRead
unknownExternal
externalWrite
externalCommunication
destructive
financial
codeExecution
```

Examples:

- calculator and local date/time are `localPure`;
- app-owned Memory is `localRead`/`localWrite` and remains separately gated by the Memory setting;
- web, Wikipedia, webpage fetch, and remote MCP reads are `networkRead`;
- calendar, reminders, location, Photos, and user-selected documents cross a user/system data boundary;
- future online inference is a data-egress operation even if the model performs no tool call;
- deletion, publication, payment, and messages to third parties use the strongest applicable class.

### 15.2 Approval defaults

Every boundary-crossing operation, not only a tool call, uses `prepare -> authorize -> execute`. This includes MCP
discovery/calls, future online-model requests, private-data and user-file access, artifact export, security-scoped
bookmark creation, and future sandbox operations. The approval engine evaluates locally trusted policy plus the
prepared operation; model output and remote metadata cannot grant or reduce authority.

`ExternalOperationPlan` is a shared `AgentContracts` envelope. Tool, provider, file, artifact, and sandbox adapters
must all produce it rather than implementing parallel approval formats.

- External reads require approval on first use in a conversation for the exact tool and bounded destination/data
  scope. A receipt may authorize subsequent matching reads in that conversation.
- Online-model inference is data egress (`externalCommunication`) scoped to one exact service destination
  and data category. Approval on first use in a conversation authorizes subsequent matching model requests
  in that conversation: same conversation, same provider/model destination, same data categories, and the
  same service-side reasoning mode. The receipt never covers a different service, model, conversation, or a
  different reasoning mode; message-content changes within the approved destination do not expand the scope.
  All other `externalCommunication` operations (MCP writes, third-party communication) keep exact
  per-invocation approval.
- Approval runs under one of three per-conversation modes, adjustable at any time and frozen per run:

  - `safePreset` (default): auto-approve in-app reads/writes and bounded network/private-data reads,
    plus online-model inference (same service destination and data category); external writes, unknown
    external, destructive, financial, and code-execution operations still ask.
  - `ask`: follow the defaults above (external reads and online-model inference approve on first use
    in the conversation).
  - `fullAccess`: auto-approve every operation inside the run capability ceiling without prompting.

  A conversation without a stored override follows the product default (Safe preset). The UI exposes
  exactly the three explicit modes (Safe preset / Ask / Full access) — "follow default" is the absence
  of an override, never a fourth radio-style mode. The settings sheet offers a "Reset to default"
  action that clears an existing override; selecting any explicit mode writes a conversation-scoped
  override that stays pinned even if the product default later changes.

  The three modes apply identically to EVERY boundary-crossing operation — local tools and in-app
  access, private/system data, online-model inference, MCP, file/artifact export — regardless of
  whether the underlying provider is on-device or remote. There is no separate local-versus-online
  approval policy.

  A mode decides whether the user is ASKED, never whether an operation is authorized: the run capability
  ceiling, the `prepare -> authorize -> execute` transaction, durable authorization records, and
  destination/data-category matching remain enforced in every mode. A mode change affects only subsequent
  runs and never expands an earlier receipt's scope.
- External writes require an exact invocation preview and approval by default.
- Reversible writes may offer an explicit conversation-scoped grant.
- Destructive, publication, financial, and third-party communication actions require exact approval every time.
- Changed normalized arguments invalidate an invocation-bound approval.
- Tool selection never implies external-access approval.
- Apple TCC authorization and agent approval are independent; both must succeed.
- The app never navigates into, clicks, or dismisses unrelated system account/configuration UI on the user's behalf.
- A background run that needs approval enters `waitingForApproval`; it does not attempt to present TCC or application
  approval UI while backgrounded.

### 15.3 Reasoning and effort

- Every model that supports reasoning/thinking — capable local checkpoints and online services — runs with
  reasoning ENABLED by default. The per-conversation Thinking control may disable it.
- Reasoning effort is a per-conversation setting with three levels: `low`, `medium` (default), `high`.
  Online providers map the level to the service's reasoning-effort knob when available (`reasoning.effort`);
  services without an effort knob ignore the level and keep their default. Local engines without an effort
  knob treat the level as advisory only — capability is on/off, and the level never fabricates thinking.
- Visible reasoning — local `<think>` output and online reasoning output — is surfaced through ONE shared
  thinking disclosure in the UI. The app never invents, requests, or persists private hidden chain-of-thought.
- A conversation-scoped online-model receipt covers one reasoning mode AND one effort level; changing
  either requires renewed approval.

### 15.4 Output budget

- The product default for ONLINE services is AUTO: `max_output_tokens` is omitted from the wire request
  so the service uses the selected model's own default/maximum output. The runtime still keeps a finite
  accounting ceiling for budgets and usage validation: the service's declared model maximum when
  configured, otherwise the conversation's online context window.
- Each online service may declare the model's real maximum output tokens (optional metadata). Explicit
  user values are clamped to `[1, min(declared max, context window)]` and sent as `max_output_tokens`;
  a per-conversation value of 0 pins auto for that thread. Local models always send an explicit budget —
  their KV context is device memory — and never use auto.
- Truncation (`incomplete_details.reason == "max_output_tokens"`, plus compatible `length`/`incomplete`
  signals) triggers ONE bounded retry with a higher explicit budget. Streamed attempts keep the text
  already shown and emit only the continuation when the retry preserves the shown prefix, so the UI
  never duplicates or splices output. Explicit-mode replies never silently exceed the user's chosen cap.
- Gateways that require `max_output_tokens` fall back to the runtime ceiling on a 400 token-limit
  rejection instead of failing the turn.

### 15.5 Server-side native tools (design decision, NOT yet implemented)

Some online services execute tools on the server instead of returning a function call for the app to run
(e.g. DeepSeek's Responses API supports `web_search` / `web_search_2025_08_26` executed server-side).
This section fixes the policy for when such support is added; no production code implements it today.

- Each online service declares its native server-side tools as per-service capability metadata
  (`nativeServerTools`, e.g. `["web_search"]`), never as a global hardcode. Model-level limitations
  (for example a service exposing a server tool only on specific models) are declared the same way per
  service/model.
- When the selected online model's service declares a native tool that mirrors an app adapter (web
  search), the frozen run advertises the NATIVE tool and omits the corresponding local adapter. The
  model must never see two competing implementations of the same capability.
- A native tool call is not executed by the app. The provider translates it: the wire `tools` payload
  carries the server tool item, streaming lifecycle events (`response.web_search_call.in_progress /
  searching / completed` or equivalents) surface as a real, user-visible tool step, and a
  `web_search_call` output item is passed back as-is in the next request's input so the server restores
  its results across turns.
- Native server tools keep the same approval semantics as local tools: `networkRead`-class effects, a
  destination scoped to `<serviceID>:<tool>`, and the three per-conversation approval modes. Approving
  the online-model inference does not by itself authorize a native tool's network read.

Approval records contain the displayed preview, normalized scope, arguments hash, policy version, timestamp, expiry,
actual host/destination matcher, redirect/fallback bounds, data-category or payload digest, descriptor/schema/trust
hashes, and user decision. The run capability ceiling is immutable for the run; every step receives an immutable
subset. Approval authorizes an operation inside that ceiling and never expands it. Future child agents may receive
only a subset of the parent's ceiling. Any time-of-check/time-of-use mismatch invalidates authorization before
external I/O.

## 16. Context compiler, Memory, and Skills

`ContextCompiler` is deterministic for a frozen run snapshot. It composes and budgets:

1. base system policy;
2. active Skill instructions and version;
3. relevant canonical-English user Memory when Memory is enabled;
4. recent conversation turns;
5. current user request and attachments;
6. compact structured run state;
7. selected artifact excerpts;
8. advertised tool schemas;
9. untrusted tool-result frames.

Every source reports estimated tokens before compilation. The compiler records inclusions, omissions, truncations,
and policy versions. The latest user turn and system policy are never silently removed.

User Memory remains a long-term fact store, not an agent scratchpad or checkpoint system. Runtime state lives in the
journal. Large tool results live as artifacts and enter context only through bounded excerpts. Tool and external
content is untrusted data and cannot grant capabilities, alter approval policy, or redefine the workflow.

## 17. Artifact system

The first release generalizes the existing attachment store into a content-addressed artifact layer.

Each artifact records:

- content hash and byte size;
- MIME type and optional semantic type;
- source run, step, tool, and external provenance;
- creation time and retention policy;
- local file reference under a confined root;
- sensitivity/redaction classification;
- integrity verification status.

Artifacts are committed atomically before their reference event. Orphan cleanup and reference counting are
deterministic and tested. Run deletion removes run-owned artifacts unless another durable record references them.
Secrets and bearer tokens are never artifacts.

User-selected files use security-scoped access and the narrowest retained bookmark necessary. File access outside
the app container remains unavailable without explicit user selection and approval.

### 17.1 Data protection and backup

- The SQLite database, `-wal`, and `-shm` use `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` so an explicitly
  authorized background task can journal after first unlock.
- User-content artifacts and retained security-scoped bookmarks use `NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen`. If data is
  unavailable while locked, the run waits for foreground/unlock; it never copies content to a weaker temporary file.
- Migration and corrupt backups inherit the source's protection class. Diagnostics are redacted before the first
  write and contain no prompt, secret, approval payload, or raw external result by default.
- Agent journals, generated artifacts, diagnostics, and transient backups are excluded from device/cloud backup by
  default. User exports follow the protection and backup policy of the destination the user selected.
- Keychain secrets remain this-device-only and are referenced by opaque identifiers.

Store creation and migration verify the effective protection and backup attributes for every database sidecar and
artifact root. Failure blocks mutation with a recoverable data-protection error.

## 18. Retry, idempotency, and uncertainty

Every failure is typed as transient, permanent, permission-related, budget-related, cancelled, incompatible, or
potentially side-effecting.

- Pure reads may retry with bounded exponential backoff and jitter.
- Writes retry automatically only when the tool declares and honors an idempotency key or supplies a reliable
  reconciliation operation.
- A timeout or transport loss after a non-idempotent external intent produces `waitingForReconciliation`; the runtime
  must not claim success, continue the ordinary loop, or replay the action.
- Duplicate suppression uses exact descriptor ID, normalized arguments, and effect scope, not raw model text.
- Cancellation propagates from run to step to model/tool execution. Noncooperative implementations are detached only
  after the journal records uncertainty and resource ownership is made safe.

## 19. iOS lifecycle and background execution

### 19.1 iOS 17 baseline

On iOS 17-25, a lifecycle coordinator aggregates all connected-scene states rather than relying on one view's
`scenePhase`. Before quiescence it obtains finite best-effort drain time with `beginBackgroundTask`; its expiration
handler issues the same idempotent, versioned quiesce command. Recovery correctness never assumes that iOS grants
enough time or that the expiration handler completes.

Leaving the foreground initiates this bounded sequence:

1. stop admitting new actions;
2. finish or cancel at the nearest safe boundary within available background time;
3. record the interrupted attempt and resulting status;
4. drain generation safely;
5. unload local weights when required by memory policy;
6. enter `waitingForForeground` if work remains.

Returning to the app does not resume automatically. The relevant conversation shows a resumable run and requires an
explicit Resume action, which then loads the pinned model.

### 19.2 iOS 26 continued processing

Where available and entitled, a user may explicitly choose continued background execution for a finite run that has
a truthful bounded progress model. Ordinary open-ended chat runs are not submitted by default. An eligible run may
register a `BGContinuedProcessingTask`; the integration:

- uses availability guards and does not raise the deployment target;
- requests GPU resources only on supported devices and only for local engines that need them;
- reports real progress to the system UI;
- handles submission failure, expiration, and user cancellation;
- uses the same journal and recovery semantics as foreground execution;
- never treats continued processing as guaranteed runtime.

The first release uses the scheduler's fail-if-not-immediately-runnable strategy, not delayed queueing, so work cannot
start later after the user has foreground-resumed it. A rejected submission leaves the run `waitingForForeground`
with a diagnostic reason; any pre-existing queued request is explicitly cancelled and that cancellation is journaled
before the same transition. Expiration and system cancellation first attempt safe quiescence and then leave resumable
work `waitingForForeground`; user cancellation from system UI maps to the explicit cancellation policy. No case
silently restarts inference or an external action.

An already-running, user-authorized continued task may keep executing when the app leaves the foreground. A normal
app launch must still not load a model or resume an unrelated run.

## 20. Unified UI and interaction model

There is one chat UI, with progressive disclosure:

- ordinary local answers render exactly like ordinary chat;
- the composer displays the conversation's allowed and pinned tool state;
- complex runs expose a compact activity row titled by the CURRENT action ("Using web search",
  "Typing…", "Approval needed"), never by an internal pipeline stage; expanding it shows one row per
  tool call, each row displaying the concrete arguments as a one-line preview ("Search: current
  year") and expanding for the full arguments and result;
- approval, question, and reconciliation surfaces are docked immediately ABOVE the composer input and
  appear only while the run is waiting on the user (Codex/Claude Code pattern); each shows the tool or
  model name, destination, exact action preview, data being sent/read, and grant scope;
- a persistent bottom control bar (above the composer input) shows the conversation's approval mode and
  reasoning effort, both switchable in place without opening a menu;
- the conversation's top-right toolbar action is an overflow menu (•••), not New Chat. It groups
  conversation actions (Rename, Delete, Add to Project), workspace pages (Workflow, Terminal, Files,
  Background tasks), and Settings. Every item opens its own page: data pages use Push navigation,
  light forms (rename, project picker) use dialogs or sheets, and Settings opens the per-conversation
  settings panel (reasoning on/off + effort, approval mode, context length, sampling including the
  online output budget with Auto, and reserved sections for future folder/file access and a shell
  terminal window);
- capabilities that are not yet implemented still get a real page with an explicit empty-state UX
  ("not enabled yet", what enabling will require) — never a disabled menu item pretending the page
  does not exist;
- Project is a pure tag grouping for conversations (many-to-many): Add to Project opens a tag picker,
  and the conversation list can filter or group by project;
- workflow presentation is MESSAGE-ANCHORED: a workflow initiated at a message renders a live record
  row directly below that message while it runs (Claude Code style) and a clickable completed record
  (e.g. "workflow: 完成任务 B") after it finishes; the record opens that workflow's summary page.
  The top-right Workflow entry shows only the LIVE summary of workflows currently running in this
  conversation; with no running workflow it is visible but disabled;
- New Chat remains available from the conversation list and the keyboard shortcut (macOS ⌘N);
- waiting states clearly distinguish user input, approval, foreground, model, and resource waits;
- submitting text to an active `InteractionRequestRecord` sends a Respond command and does not create a new root run;
- the user can Pause, Resume, or Stop the run;
- a neutral launch still exposes pending runs through conversation badges or a run inbox without navigating to one;
- partial output is visibly marked incomplete and never confused with a committed final answer;
- tool and model failures show a specific recovery action rather than an empty bubble;
- elapsed reasoning and activity time derive from runtime events, not disclosure visibility;
- opening the app starts at the normal neutral shell, not the prior conversation or an auto-loaded model.

The UI displays operational summaries, model-provided visible reasoning where supported and enabled, tool activity,
and evidence. It does not invent, request, or persist private hidden chain-of-thought.

Approval previews, destinations, data categories, and destructive warnings must remain fully accessible with
VoiceOver and at the largest Dynamic Type sizes; critical text may scroll but may not truncate. Primary approval and
denial actions require distinct labels, stable focus order, and protection against accidental double activation.

The workflow summary page follows the Claude Code subagent pattern: a tree of run nodes, each showing
status (running spinner / completed / failed / waiting for approval), elapsed time (live while running),
consumed input/output tokens, tool-invocation count, and an expandable step list reusing the agent
activity panel's step rows. Progress may add a mini per-node activity timeline (one dot per tool call)
once the workflow runtime lands; the page must not show anything while no workflow is running.

## 21. Agent Sandbox Runtime compatibility seam

### 21.1 Isolation from the private implementation

The open-source repository defines only `AgentSandboxAPI`. It must compile and function with no sandbox provider.
The future commercial runtime may be integrated as a private Swift package, binary XCFramework, or another adapter,
but the harness must not depend on its concrete types, implementation details, storage, or entitlements.

The public app uses an absent provider by default. When absent:

- sandbox-required tools are not advertised;
- existing agent behavior remains fully functional;
- the UI may describe the capability as unavailable but must not show a broken control.

### 21.2 Two-level integration

The sandbox is an execution environment, not merely one string-returning tool. Integration has two levels:

1. `AgentSandboxProvider` exposes versioned capabilities and durable execution handles.
2. tool adapters expose the operations a model may request within an authorized session.

This first version is explicitly an experimental compatibility contract. It freezes only the semantics that are
already required by the harness and future authority model:

```swift
protocol AgentSandboxProvider: Sendable {
    var descriptor: AgentSandboxProviderDescriptor { get }
    func capabilities() async throws -> SandboxCapabilities
    func start(
        _ request: SandboxExecutionRequest,
        idempotencyKey: String
    ) async throws -> SandboxExecutionHandleID
    func attach(to id: SandboxExecutionHandleID) async throws -> any SandboxExecutionHandle
}

protocol SandboxExecutionHandle: Sendable {
    var id: SandboxExecutionHandleID { get }
    func events(after cursor: AgentEventCursor?) -> AsyncThrowingStream<SandboxEventEnvelope, Error>
    func status() async throws -> SandboxExecutionStatus
    func result() async throws -> SandboxExecutionResult?
    func send(_ command: SandboxCommandEnvelope) async throws -> SandboxCommandReceipt
}
```

The versioned envelopes reserve:

- semantic protocol version and capability negotiation;
- opaque execution, artifact, optional workspace, and optional checkpoint handles;
- declarative filesystem, network, process, and code-execution requirements;
- immutable authority and resource-budget envelopes;
- secret references without plaintext persistence;
- resumable event cursors, structured progress, result, error, and artifact envelopes;
- typed failures and uncertain side-effect reporting;
- audit events and redaction metadata.

`start` is idempotent for its key. Ending an event subscription only detaches the observer; it never cancels execution.
Commands are explicitly targeted and idempotent. A sandbox execution receives an immutable capability subset and
cannot request broader authority. Its output and self-described capabilities are untrusted until checked against the
locally registered provider policy.

Mount representation, snapshot mechanics, process model, transport, resource accounting implementation, binary ABI,
and distribution remain deferred until the real private provider is integrated. The current contract fake verifies
versioning, authority attenuation, idempotent start/commands, detach/reattach, event cursors, and typed outcomes only;
no placeholder production sandbox is built.

## 22. Subagent compatibility seam

The root agent itself uses the future durable execution unit:

```swift
protocol AgentExecutor: Sendable {
    func submit(_ request: AgentRequest, commandID: AgentCommandID)
        async throws -> AgentExecutionHandleID
    func attach(to id: AgentExecutionHandleID) async throws -> any AgentExecutionHandle
}

protocol AgentExecutionHandle: Sendable {
    var id: AgentExecutionHandleID { get }
    func events(after cursor: AgentEventCursor?) -> AsyncThrowingStream<AgentEventEnvelope, Error>
    func status() async throws -> AgentRunStatus
    func result() async throws -> AgentResult?
    func send(_ command: AgentCommandEnvelope) async throws -> AgentCommandReceipt
}
```

`submit` is idempotent for `commandID`. Event cursors are durable and reconnectable. Ending an event subscription or
destroying a view only detaches observation; only an explicit versioned Pause, Resume, Cancel, Approve, Reconcile, or
Respond command changes the run. Commands carry target run/request IDs and expected state version.

`AgentRequest` reserves:

- run and optional parent-run ID;
- requesting step ID;
- role/instruction and output schema;
- model policy;
- run capability ceiling;
- independent budget;
- context and artifact references;
- optional sandbox requirement;
- labels and provenance.

The current release advertises `SubagentSpawner` only when the spawner is available and executes independent children
in deterministic batches of at most four. Local decoding remains serialized by the resource arbiter, while online or
non-model work may overlap. Every batch drains at a deterministic barrier before its phase advances. Subagents:

- inherit only a strict subset of parent capabilities;
- receive independent contexts and budgets;
- return structured results and artifacts rather than full transcripts;
- cannot approve their own external access;
- pass local model generation through the same single-resource arbiter;
- remain visible as child runs in the journal.

Workflow triggering is harness-supported: the harness starts a multi-subagent workflow when the user
asks for multi-agent work in a message, and a standalone `/workflow` marker is the deterministic trigger
whether it appears before, within, or after the goal. The marker is removed before generation; longer
slash commands and URL path components do not match. Every workflow remains durably anchored to its
initiating message so the journal can reconstruct the full child-run tree after relaunch.

Implementation order (see §30): the subagent spawner landed first, then bounded parallel tool batches,
then the staged orchestrator, and now bounded parallel child execution.

## 23. Unified staged and Dynamic Workflows boundary

The staged workflow runtime and P0 Dynamic Workflows runtime both create, sequence, and verify `AgentRequest` values.
Dynamic branching, bounded repetition, joins, and saved scripts execute above the same `AgentExecutor` boundary (§34).

The harness exposes the contracts used by both orchestration paths:

- stable run, step, parent, and artifact identities;
- structured inputs and outputs;
- immutable run capability ceilings and attenuated step grants;
- independent budgets and usage ledgers;
- resumable execution events;
- provider-neutral model routing;
- sandbox requirements;
- explicit verification/evidence fields.

No workflow script or staged plan receives direct filesystem, network, tool, or sandbox authority. It coordinates
agents; agents act through the same policy-controlled runtime. Dynamic Workflows add a content-addressed JavaScript
script ABI, saved versions, hash-chained run events, prefix-correct recovery, and background controls without replacing
the staged record identities, artifacts, or message anchors.

Each workflow persists a record on its initiating message with: workflow id, title (e.g. "完成任务 B"),
status (running / completed / failed / cancelled), start and end time, aggregated statistics (subagent
count, elapsed time, input/output tokens, tool-invocation count), and a reference to the journal root
run. While running, the record renders live below the initiating message and the top-right Workflow
entry shows the real-time tree summary; after completion the record becomes the clickable archive entry
that opens the same summary page in its completed state.

### 23.1 Phase and handoff contracts

The staged workflow runtime decomposes the initiating goal into durable, reviewable phases
before any child run starts. The decomposition is a first-class journal record, not hidden
chain-of-thought: each phase names its inputs, expected outputs, acceptance criteria, dependency
order, and any approval gate the user must pass before that phase executes. A phase may fan out to
multiple child runs; the orchestrator executes them in bounded batches, fans their results back in by
stable child index, and advances only when the phase's acceptance criteria are met. Dynamic script execution uses the
separate §34 journal and projects into these same product-facing records; it does not translate scripts into a static
graph.

Child runs communicate through versioned artifacts and structured handoff records, never through a
free-form agent-to-agent chat channel or full-transcript passing. The orchestrator holds no direct
filesystem, network, tool, or sandbox authority: it coordinates runs, and every artifact reference
travels through the same policy-controlled runtime and ceiling attenuation as any other operation.

Each phase persists a `WorkflowPhaseRecord`:

- phase ID, sequence number, and status (pending / running / waiting / completed / failed /
  cancelled);
- input artifact references and output artifact references — references, not content copies; the
  referenced artifacts are scoped and integrity-checked;
- acceptance criteria;
- start/end time and aggregated statistics (child-run count, elapsed time, input/output tokens,
  tool-invocation count).

Before a child run starts, the orchestrator writes a `WorkflowHandoff` containing:

- the child run's task brief: goal, constraints, and the acceptance criteria it must satisfy;
- references to the upstream artifacts the child may read;
- the key decisions and known risks or uncertainties the upstream phase recorded;
- the explicit verification duties the child must perform before reporting completion
  ("verify X", never "assume X").

Coding and analysis workflows therefore take the shape of a dataflow graph: one phase reads upstream
artifacts, writes its own artifacts, and hands a distilled handoff to the next phase. This keeps
context bounded, keeps every edge durable and resumable, and lets a reviewer phase consume exactly
the diff or position artifacts an implementer phase produced. The UI continues to render this tree
through the message-anchored record and summary page fixed in §20.

## 24. Security and privacy requirements

- Local inference remains local. Future online inference is opt-in and visibly classified as data egress.
- Run capability ceilings are deny-by-default and immutable for a run; step grants are auditable immutable subsets
  and future child ceilings are attenuated subsets.
- External content is separated from control instructions and labeled untrusted.
- Tool names are namespaced; schema hashes prevent silent tool substitution during resume.
- Approval receipts bind normalized scope and policy version.
- Network tools retain scheme, public-address, redirect, and response-size protections.
- MCP credentials and future provider secrets live in Keychain and are exposed only by opaque references.
- Logs redact secrets, personal data, approval payloads where required, and large external content.
- Artifacts are root-confined, integrity-checked, and purged according to ownership and retention.
- User-selected file access uses security-scoped URLs and resists path traversal and symlink escape.
- Prompt injection cannot enable tools, increase budgets, grant approval, or alter the runtime state machine.
- No automated test or agent flow may click unrelated system setup, account, email, or permission UI.

## 25. Observability

Every run exposes a redacted event stream sufficient to answer:

- what is running and why;
- which model/provider/variant is pinned;
- which tools were allowed, advertised, proposed, approved, and executed;
- what external destination or private data was involved;
- current and cumulative tokens, duration, tool count, and network/artifact bytes;
- what is blocking progress;
- why a retry occurred;
- whether an external side effect is confirmed or uncertain;
- why and where the run terminated.

Operational logs and durable user history are separate. Verbose diagnostics are opt-in and locally retained with
bounded size. Production correctness must not depend on telemetry or a remote service.

## 26. Backward compatibility and rollout

- Existing conversations, Memory, Skills, downloaded models, MCP settings, and tool choices remain readable.
- Existing flattened `ToolRun` entries remain displayable as legacy history but are not reconstructed into fake agent
  journals.
- Conversation records gain optional run references plus the versioned `ConversationToolPolicy`. Legacy policy
  materialization is one-time and never silently expands after later global setting changes.
- New-runtime user and assistant messages project from the canonical journal through the durable outbox; startup and
  explicit resume reconcile any unacknowledged projection before accepting conflicting mutations.
- The current `ToolLoop` remains behind a compatibility adapter during migration, then is removed only after every
  supported model and tool passes the new runtime contract tests.
- The feature must be guarded by an internal rollout switch until recovery, approval, and real-device suites pass.
- Rollback must leave conversations and existing settings readable even if new resumable runs become unavailable.

## 27. Test strategy

Testing is a release-control system, not a post-implementation demonstration. Every normative requirement, security
boundary, state transition, and acceptance criterion in this specification must map to at least one automated test ID
or, only where automation is impossible, a named physical-device inspection with recorded evidence. The mapping lives
in a versioned requirements-to-tests manifest. Each entry has a stable `RequirementID` using the `AH-<AREA>-<NUMBER>`
format, risk tier, source-spec anchor, test IDs, platform, execution tier/cadence, and required evidence. CI rejects
unknown, duplicated, stale, or unmapped requirement/test IDs and any unexpected skip. A passing build, screenshot,
process exit, or final `OK` token is not evidence that an agent scenario succeeded: tests must assert the requested
output contract, journaled state, tool and approval history, side effects, and absence of forbidden actions.

### 27.1 Deterministic unit and property tests

- every legal and illegal state transition;
- event replay and projection determinism;
- schema migration fixtures;
- crash injection before and after every stable event boundary;
- duplicate and out-of-order event rejection;
- expected-version CAS races among approval, cancellation, lifecycle expiration, and tool/model callbacks;
- tool selection restricted to the conversation-allowed set;
- bounded Draft 2020-12 schema preservation, enforcement markers, canonicalization, and complexity limits;
- approval scope and arguments-hash binding;
- approval time-of-check/time-of-use expansion rejection;
- malicious remote descriptor attempts to downgrade effect, retry, or approval classification;
- budget enforcement and no-progress termination;
- retry, idempotency, and uncertain-result classification;
- context budget accounting and deterministic compilation;
- artifact integrity, confinement, reference counting, and cleanup;
- file-protection, backup-exclusion, device-lock, disk-full, WAL corruption, and migration-backup behavior;
- cross-store outbox crashes at send, final-answer, undo, and delete boundaries;
- cascade deletion of journal rows, approvals, bookmarks, sidecars, artifacts, backups, and diagnostics;
- cancellation propagation and noncooperative implementation handling;
- capability attenuation for reserved child and sandbox contracts;
- fuzzing of model tool-call syntax, MCP schemas/results, and persisted event envelopes.

All public commands, event variants, terminal reasons, approval decisions, recovery dispositions, and legal and
illegal state-machine edges have explicit contract cases. Security-sensitive negative paths are first-class tests:
denied, stale, widened, malformed, untrusted, over-budget, and replayed inputs must be proven unable to cross their
boundary.

The run-state transition matrix, approval decision matrix, and crash/fault boundaries are versioned, machine-enumerable
tables shared with their tests. Completeness gates enumerate every `state x command x guard` row, every approval-policy
decision row, and every registered fault point; adding or changing a case without corresponding test evidence fails CI.
Their required 100% coverage refers to these semantic registries, not a line-coverage approximation.

Tests use a virtual clock, deterministic IDs, scripted model providers, fake tools, fake approval responders, faulting
storage, and a protocol-level fake sandbox provider. The fake sandbox validates the public API only and is not a
production sandbox implementation.

### 27.2 Integration tests

- pure chat performs exactly one model pass; deterministic local tool selection may run, but no additional model
  inference pass is used for selection;
- multi-tool chains produce one committed final answer;
- malformed tool output receives one repair and then terminates;
- an image question never enables or invokes Web Search unless that conversation allows it and approval succeeds;
- Memory save/recall remains canonical, durable, and independent of master tool availability where intended;
- MCP tool names, complete schemas, structured results, cancellation, and failure states survive adaptation;
- external read and write approval, denial, expiry, changed arguments, and background waiting;
- MCP setup/refresh approval before `initialize` or `tools/list`, stable server identity, and unknown-effect defaults;
- app termination during model generation, approval, pure read, idempotent write, and uncertain write;
- mixed multi-tool batches with denial, failure, and reconciliation in each ordinal position;
- stale or duplicate approve/respond/pause/resume/cancel commands from old UI projections;
- resume with missing model, changed tool schema, removed Skill, or revoked system permission;
- multi-scene foreground aggregation and iOS 17 background-task expiration;
- continued-processing submit success, queue, rejection, expiration, system cancellation, and user cancellation;
- VoiceOver, maximum Dynamic Type, untruncated approval scope, stable focus, and double-activation protection;
- stopping a run does not finalize a ghost answer or cancel a newer run;
- app launch does not select a conversation, load a model, or resume a run.

### 27.3 Real-device matrix

Real-device validation is mandatory for at least:

- Bonsai 8B 1-bit;
- Gemma 4 E2B in its installed supported variant;
- Apple Intelligence where available;
- one vision-capable GGUF model;
- iOS 17 baseline behavior on an available compatible device or dedicated device farm;
- iOS 26 continued-processing behavior on a supported device.

Each capable model is tested for ordinary chat, selected-tool calls, multi-step completion, memory, malformed calls,
duplicate suppression, stop, foreground/background transition, recovery, and final-answer conformance. Vision tests
verify that the image is used directly and that Web Search does not activate without the required user decisions.

Real-model assertions use deterministic decoding where the provider supports it. Where byte-for-byte output cannot be
made deterministic, the oracle validates a bounded structured contract or semantic invariants rather than accepting
arbitrary prose. For example, a requested JSON shape must parse and match its schema, a Memory scenario must recall the
stored fact in a later turn, and a tool scenario must contain the expected authorized tool record and final-answer
evidence. Merely observing that inference ended is never a pass.

The release matrix includes both a clean-install path and an upgrade path with legacy conversations, Memory, Skills,
tool policy, and downloaded-model metadata. Required offline, device-lock, memory-pressure, background/foreground,
termination/relaunch, and storage-pressure scenarios run on physical hardware wherever the operating-system behavior
cannot be faithfully simulated. Provisioned model artifacts may be reused read-only to control download cost, but each
scenario receives an isolated conversation/database/artifact namespace and cannot depend on the outcome or ordering of
a previous test.

The device harness must never interact with unrelated system dialogs. Unexpected system UI is captured as a test
failure with diagnostics.

### 27.4 Performance and resource gates

- no measurable extra model round trip for ordinary chat;
- tool selection completes without model inference;
- time-to-first-visible-output regression stays within the quantitative baseline gates below;
- journal writes do not occur per token and do not stall streaming;
- database and artifact storage remain bounded and recoverable;
- one resident local model invariant is maintained under cancellation, backgrounding, and switching;
- thermal and memory-pressure behavior remains safe on the smallest supported device tier;
- no run can exceed hard budgets through retries, repair, or resume.

Performance gates are compared with a checked-in benchmark definition and a recorded pre-migration baseline using the
same device class, OS build, model artifact digest, engine, prompt fixture, and thermal starting state. Ordinary-chat
median time to first visible output may not regress by more than 10%, p95 by more than 15%, or add a model pass. Any
intentional exception requires measured evidence and an explicit release decision; an unspecified "agreed threshold"
is not sufficient.

### 27.5 Coverage and release gates

Coverage is measured per production target and for the changed executable lines, not only as a repository-wide number
that legacy code can dilute. Percentage denominators use compiler source mappings for hand-written executable code;
compiler-synthesized accessors and async state-machine artifacts with no stable source mapping, generated sources, and
structurally non-executable declarations may be excluded only by a versioned allowlist with a written reason. UI views,
adapters, error paths, and difficult asynchronous code are not excluded merely because they are hard to test.
Coverage-only test hooks must not create behavior unavailable in the production build.

The following are minimum release floors, not completion goals:

- new `AgentContracts` and `AgentRuntime` targets: at least 90% executable-line coverage and 90% executable-function
  coverage;
- the state reducer, journal/CAS transitions, approval policy and operation fingerprinting, budget/no-progress logic,
  outbox, recovery/reconciliation, artifact confinement/deletion, lifecycle quiescence, and capability attenuation:
  at least 95% executable-line coverage, every executable function covered, and every decision-table row represented;
- new or changed executable lines in Agent Harness production targets and their model/tool/UI adapters: at least 90%
  coverage;
- `AgentSandboxAPI`: every public request, command, event, result, error, detach/reattach, cancellation, and authority-
  attenuation contract exercised through the protocol-level fake provider, even where protocol declarations have no
  executable lines to count;
- 100% explicit coverage of the legal/illegal run-state transition matrix, terminal outcomes, external-operation
  allow/deny classifications, and the crash boundaries named in this specification.

Line or function percentage cannot compensate for a missing invariant. A small curated mutation suite must prove that
tests fail when critical allow/deny decisions are inverted, expected-state-version checks are removed, an authorized
operation is widened, idempotency keys are ignored, terminal uniqueness is broken, or a budget comparison is weakened.
All such seeded mutations must be killed before release.

Verification runs in four enforced tiers:

1. Every change: deterministic unit, contract, state-machine, migration, and property tests for affected MLX-free
   packages, with a fixed reproducible seed and a separately recorded rotating seed.
2. Pull request: the complete MLX-free suite with coverage gates, app and engine builds, engine tests, simulator UI
   tests, integration tests, schema/persistence fuzz smoke tests, and representative crash-injection shards.
3. Nightly and before a release candidate: the full fuzz corpus, all crash points, storage/device-lock faults,
   concurrency stress, leak/resource checks, and bounded long-run/thermal tests.
4. Release candidate: the complete required physical-device/model matrix, clean-install and upgrade paths, followed by
   rerunning every failed scenario after its fix and the full affected matrix rather than only the previously failing
   case.

P0 requirements cover authorization bypass, operation-plan widening, duplicate or uncertain external writes,
journal/outbox loss or duplication, destructive deletion, recovery and lifecycle corruption, capability escalation,
and any launch-time automatic model load, conversation navigation, run resume, or external action. A P0 failure,
timeout, crash, unexpected skip, missing evidence, or first-attempt failure blocks the relevant integration or release
gate. P0 tests cannot be quarantined, and a diagnostic rerun cannot rewrite their first-attempt outcome.

Before the first Agent Harness production-code change, the repository must add the traceability manifest, generated or
scripted model fixtures, deterministic app-container reset/provisioning, and checked-in `.xctestplan` files. SwiftPM
coverage is collected with its coverage mode; Xcode tests use `-enableCodeCoverage YES` and an explicit
`-resultBundlePath`. Versioned scripts (`scripts/verification/`, `agent-harness-verify`) normalize SwiftPM/LLVM and `xccov` results, enforce target/diff floors and
test discovery, and publish machine-readable reports plus redacted result bundles. In this document "CI" names a gate, not a hosted runner: since 2026-09-06 the hosted GitHub workflow runs portable Swift contract/API/verifier tests on Linux in addition to JSON/test-plan validity, script syntax, and spec-digest binding and every
macOS-dependent gate (SwiftPM package tests and coverage, mutation kills, simulator UI, engine tests, nightly fault/fuzz, and controlled physical-device runs) is executed by those scripts on a maintainer Mac, with its evidence attached to the release record; such gates are
considered implemented only when that evidence exists for the release-candidate commit. Simulator UI fixtures must not depend on a
developer manually seeding a GGUF file.

The CI gate compares coverage against both these floors and the target's accepted baseline; a change may not lower the
baseline without an explicit, reviewed justification. Test discovery itself is checked so that an accidentally empty
suite or skipped target cannot report success. Unexpected skips, crashes, timeouts, or missing result bundles fail the
gate.

Flaky tests are defects. An automatic retry may collect diagnostics but does not erase the original failure from
release evidence. Quarantine requires a tracked owner, reason, expiry, and replacement coverage; no security,
persistence, approval, deletion, recovery, or required real-device test may be quarantined for release. Non-P0
quarantine expires after at most seven days; an expired entry fails CI rather than silently extending itself.

Every release-candidate verification record contains the source commit, test-plan version, Xcode/Swift and OS builds,
device class with a privacy-safe identifier, locale/region/time zone, app build, permission state, available memory and
disk, thermal state, model/provider/engine and artifact digest, sampling configuration and deterministic seeds,
scenario-level assertions, duration/resource measurements, redacted logs, and `.xcresult`/coverage artifacts. Evidence
must be sufficient for an independent reviewer to distinguish "the app stayed alive" from "the requested behavior and
all safety invariants were verified."

## 28. Acceptance criteria

The first release is complete only when all of the following are true:

1. Ordinary chat, reasoning display, vision, Memory, Skills, built-in tools, and MCP run through `AgentRuntime` without
   behavior regression.
2. `ChatStore` no longer owns the agent loop or durable execution state.
3. Every run has a replayable journal and explicit terminal or waiting state.
4. Every external operation enforces `prepare -> authorize -> execute`; it cannot exceed the immutable authorized
   destination, data, argument, redirect/fallback, and effect plan.
5. Conversation-persistent intelligent tool selection cannot expand the allowed set.
6. No malformed output, duplicate call, retry, background transition, or resume path can create an infinite loop.
7. Non-idempotent uncertain actions are never silently replayed or reported as successful.
8. App launch remains neutral: no automatic model load, conversation navigation, or run resume.
9. The open-source build works with no sandbox provider and contains no private-runtime implementation dependency.
10. Journal/outbox recovery cannot produce a missing or duplicate accepted user message, final answer, or deletion.
11. `AgentExecutor` and experimental `AgentSandboxAPI` handles support idempotent start/commands, cursor-based
    detach/reattach, and subscription cancellation without cancelling execution.
12. Data protection, backup exclusion, device-lock behavior, and conversation/Delete All cascades pass fault tests.
13. All MLX-free package tests, app build tests, UI tests, fault-injection tests, and required physical-device scenarios
    pass; the requirements-to-tests manifest has no uncovered normative requirement, all quantitative coverage and
    mutation gates in section 27.5 pass, and the release evidence proves scenario outcomes rather than mere completion.
14. One independent post-implementation audit finds no unresolved release-blocking correctness, persistence,
    permission, privacy, or lifecycle issue.

## 29. Implementation sequence

Implementation is one dependency-ordered program, followed by one consolidated independent audit:

**Status (2026-08-09):** the runtime, SQLite journal and idempotent conversation outbox projection, Tool V2/MCP/
online adapters, approvals, budgets, subagents, bounded parallel tool batches, staged workflow orchestrator,
explicit workflow recovery, progressive UI, static traceability gate, and a deterministic model-free simulator
gate (`SimulatorCI` plan) are implemented. Maximum-Dynamic-Type approval coverage, complete semantic-registry evaluation, a curated
six-mutant source gate, and commit/spec-bound coverage freshness enforcement are also implemented. The implementation
is not release-green: matched device performance evidence, the complete physical-device matrix, and consolidated
release evidence remain open. Step 6 is in progress; steps 7-8 remain pending.

1. Establish stable requirement/test IDs, risk tiers, semantic registries, coverage collection, deterministic fixtures,
   and CI discovery gates; then freeze value types, IDs, state machine, event envelope, Tool V2, model-provider,
   approval, `AgentExecutor`, and `AgentSandboxAPI` contracts with exhaustive contract tests.
2. Add the SQLite journal, projections, artifact store, deterministic context compiler, and recovery tests.
3. Adapt local models, existing tools, MCP, Memory, and Skills behind the new contracts.
4. Implement the runtime controller, resource arbiter, budgets, retries, approval engine, and iOS lifecycle behavior.
5. Replace ChatStore orchestration with commands/projections and add progressive activity/approval/resume UI.
6. Enforce the requirements traceability, quantitative coverage, mutation, simulator, fault-injection, performance,
   and physical-device gates, and archive reproducible release evidence.
7. After steps 1-6 are complete and their evidence is assembled, conduct one independent, repository-wide audit
   against the entire specification. The audit returns one consolidated, severity-ranked findings set.
8. Address all accepted release-blocking findings together in one bounded remediation wave, rerun the complete
   verification suite once, perform a closure check limited to those findings and regressions, and prepare the release
   decision.

### 29.1 Audit cadence and stop rule

The program must not alternate formal independent audits with partial implementation. Steps 1-6 are one implementation
wave. Normal developer review, compilation, automated tests, static checks, and fixing failures discovered by those
checks remain continuous engineering work; they are not separate audit rounds and do not reopen the architecture after
each component. No phase, package, pull request, or individual feature triggers an independent product audit while the
planned implementation wave is incomplete.

The sole full audit begins only when the complete release candidate satisfies the implementation checklist and has
full test evidence. Reviewers inspect the integrated system once, not a succession of knowingly incomplete snapshots.
All audit findings are triaged together before remediation begins, so fixes can be designed coherently instead of
causing issue-by-issue audit churn.

After the single remediation wave, the closure check verifies only that the consolidated blockers are resolved, no
specified invariant regressed, and the full suite still passes. It is not a new open-ended audit. If a release blocker
remains or remediation would require a material architectural change, stop and report a release decision/blocker rather
than entering an unbounded `implement -> audit -> implement -> audit` loop. Non-blocking improvements are deferred to a
later explicitly scoped release.

No production implementation begins until this specification has completed independent review and its blocking
findings have been resolved.

## 30. Deferred decisions after the Dynamic Workflows milestone

These decisions are intentionally deferred because the corresponding capability is not implemented now:

- additional online-provider protocols, pricing UI, automatic routing, and cost policy;
- server-side native tools (e.g. DeepSeek `web_search`): policy recorded in §15.5, implementation
  deferred until the capability metadata, provider translation, step UI, and approval wiring land together;
- the private sandbox runtime's transport, packaging, entitlements, and binary distribution;
- remote/cross-device concurrency (local spawning, bounded parallel tool batches, bounded parallel
  subagent execution, and the staged workflow orchestrator are implemented and are not deferred);
- alternate hard-isolated workflow providers, richer saved-workflow distribution, and private-runtime packaging;
- distributed or cross-device execution.

The multi-agent implementation order is fixed and has shipped: (1) `SubagentSpawner` with durable
child runs, attenuated ceilings, independent budgets/contexts, structured results and artifacts, and
child visibility in the journal (§22); (2) bounded parallel tool batches inside one run under the same
ceiling, budget ledger, duplicate suppression, and reconciliation invariants (§12); (3) the staged
workflow orchestrator with phase decomposition, fan-out/fan-in, `WorkflowPhaseRecord`, and
`WorkflowHandoff` dataflow (§23/§23.1); and (4) bounded parallel subagent batches with deterministic
fan-in. The current P0 implementation adds the Claude-style Dynamic Workflows analyzer, replaceable script provider,
event-sourced scheduler, saved versions, and exact recovery (§34). Only remote/cross-device execution and
private-runtime integration details remain priority-deferred.

Their future implementations must honor the contracts and authority boundaries established here.

## 31. Independent specification review

An independent read-only architecture review completed on 2026-08-01 with the verdict **approve with required
changes**. This revision incorporates its blocking findings:

- enforceable `prepare -> authorize -> execute` boundaries across all external access;
- one canonical journal plus durable idempotent ConversationStore projection;
- unambiguous final-answer, multi-tool, user-input, foreground, and reconciliation states;
- run ownership, versioned idempotent commands, database CAS, and durable pause semantics;
- one-time per-conversation tool-policy migration and conservative MCP trust mapping;
- explicit iOS 17 quiescence and bounded iOS 26 continued-processing eligibility;
- reconnectable durable AgentExecutor and minimal experimental sandbox handles;
- data protection, backup, deletion, accessibility, and corresponding fault-injection requirements.
- separate logical conversation tool identity from exact run/approval descriptor identity;
- bind future online-model generation to the same prepared and authorized external-operation contract.

The review originally deferred full Dynamic Workflows; a staged orchestrator and bounded parallel scheduler landed
later. Product priority now supersedes that deferral through the explicit P0 program in §34.

A separate independent test-strategy review completed on 2026-08-01. After the specification added stable
requirement/test IDs, semantic completeness registries, P0 gates, automated coverage/result collection, isolated
device fixtures, richer device evidence, and bounded flake quarantine, the reviewer returned **APPROVE** with no
remaining blocker.

## 33. Current implementation conformance (2026-08-08)

This section records known gaps between the normative requirements above and the current `main` implementation. It
does not waive or redefine those requirements. A gap remains open until implementation and required evidence agree.

Implemented foundations:

- durable root runs, frozen inputs, SQLite events/CAS, budgets, approvals, reconciliation, and artifact storage;
- local providers plus explicitly configured OpenAI-compatible Responses providers;
- Tool V2 adapters, MCP, per-conversation tool policy and approval mode;
- durable subagent runs with strict authority/budget attenuation and bounded parallel child batches;
- bounded parallel tool batches and a message-anchored staged workflow orchestrator;
- iOS 17 quiescence and iOS 26 continued-processing integration seams.

Open conformance gaps:

1. **Workflow tool policy:** CLOSED (2026-08-08). Workflow roots and children inherit the initiating
   conversation's exact manually selected tool policy and never widen it. Workflows have no hard-coded dependency
   on `web_search` or `fetch_webpage`; a goal that needs no external research can run with both disabled.
   `SubagentSpawner` continues to strictly attenuate every child's ceiling. Evidence: workflow launcher policy
   integration, `ChatStoreWorkflowTests`, `WorkflowStoreTests`, and the AgentRuntime workflow suite.
2. **Conversation projection:** CLOSED (2026-08-09). `ConversationOutboxProjector` claims journal outbox rows
   (`acceptedUserMessage` / `finalAnswer` / internal-run acknowledgements / `deleteConversation`), applies only
   user-visible rows to the conversation JSON
   idempotently (never duplicating a user message or overwriting a committed answer), and acknowledges delivery.
   It drains at bootstrap, on run start/terminal, and on foreground resume. Workflow root/child final answers are
   acknowledged without raw projection (the workflow summary path owns them). `ChatStore`'s live callbacks remain
   as an optimistic UI projection that the outbox path reconciles; the request now freezes both the caller-owned
   user-message ID and response-placeholder ID so journal and UI use the same identities end to end. Workflow
   generators and subagents instead use run-scoped message identities plus durable no-op acknowledgements, preventing
   repeated/parallel internal runs from colliding in SQLite or leaking prompts/results into chat. The journal
   remains the recovery authority. Evidence: `ConversationOutboxProjectorTests`, the app request-binding test, and
   the AgentRuntime journal/outbox identity integration test.
3. **Workflow relaunch:** CLOSED (2026-08-08). `WorkflowOrchestrator.resume` reconstructs an unfinished workflow
   from its durable summary/plan; `WorkflowLauncher.resume` rebuilds the child tool-policy template, reconstructs
   the parent context from the JOURNALED root request (frozen ceiling/budget/model policy), and `advance`
   re-collects already-durably-spawned children idempotently — no duplicate child IDs, usage, or completion counts.
   App bootstrap only installs the recovery handler: it never resumes work automatically. A running workflow stays
   inert until the user presses **Resume**, and recovery errors remain visible while durable state stays resumable.
   Evidence: `MultiAgentWorkflowIntegrationTests` and `WorkflowStoreTests` explicit-resume coverage.
4. **Compatibility fallback:** CLOSED (2026-08-08). Production assembly now performs one explicit
   `AgentRuntimeAssembly` attempt. Failure records the diagnostic, disables sending, and presents a visible
   restart-required composer state; it never silently executes the legacy `ToolLoop`. Tests/previews may still
   construct an intentionally unwired `ChatStore` to cover legacy compatibility in isolation.
5. **Verification enforcement:** the checked-in pull-request simulator gate executes deterministic, model-free
   neutral-launch/navigation and maximum-Dynamic-Type approval XCUITests. The approval test asserts full action,
   destination, data, effects, warning, distinct decisions, and one-shot activation. The complete registry oracle
   evaluates all 6,328 cells with fixed and rotating seeds, while the curated mutation runner requires six real
   production-source mutants to be killed by six distinct executed tests; compile/setup failures cannot count as kills.
   Rich online-model tests and the physical-device plan remain credentialed release gates. `AHT-PERF-001` (matched
   latency/resource baselines) still requires a device + recorded baseline and remains planned. The static semantic
   gate is green (2026-08-07): the verifier's frozen axes include `approvalCommandRouting.operationKind` and
   `trustedProgressRouting.modelNeedsApproval`, and its expected routes match `AgentRunReducer` /
   `ApprovalDecisionTables` — model-provider approval resumes the model path (`waitingForModel`), denial
   terminates (`failed`/`permissionDenied`), `modelNeedsApproval` parks the run in `waitingForApproval`, and
   `AH-APPROVAL-AUTHORITY-022` recognizes conversation-scoped online-model consent
   (`authorizeMatchingReceipt`/`boundedConversationRead`). `agent-harness-verify static` exits 0.
6. **Evidence freshness:** CLOSED for automated package coverage (2026-08-09). Every report records its source commit,
   exact `spec.md` digest, source-tree cleanliness, structured test-result digest, and diff digest; the freshness gate (`agent-harness-verify freshness`, run on a maintainer Mac since hosted macOS CI was retired on 2026-08-15) consumes all package
   reports and fails closed unless the required set is successful, clean, and bound to the same expected commit/spec.
   Physical-device results must still be regenerated from that release-candidate commit before the consolidated audit.
7. **Accepted-send execution snapshot:** CLOSED (2026-08-08). `ChatStore` now asks `AgentRunStore` to capture an
   immutable submission recipe synchronously after appending the accepted user/assistant identities and before the
   first attachment write or model-residency await. Deferred artifact resolution builds only from that captured value.
   Snapshot lookup derives model, variant, sampling, context, skill, tool policy, approval mode, and reasoning settings
   from the requested conversation rather than the visible conversation. The freezer handoff is keyed by run ID so
   concurrent preparations cannot replace one another. Online selections also carry a digest identity for the exact
   accepted service endpoint/reasoning/output configuration, so later settings edits or another service cannot redirect
   an in-flight or recovered run; the API key remains a Keychain reference resolved only at execution.

Terminology: **staged multi-agent workflows v1** remains the compatibility planner. **Dynamic Workflows** is the P0
Claude Code-style JavaScript orchestration runtime with branching, repetition, saved versioned scripts, parallel
subagents, background observability, and prefix-correct recovery. It is not a static DAG product.

## 34. P0 full Dynamic Workflows program

Full Dynamic Workflows and production-quality parallel subagents are the current highest-priority capability.
“Full” means a durable, versioned workflow definition and execution system, not a larger prompt wrapped around the
staged orchestrator. The implementation must preserve the iOS 17 target, local-first behavior, online-model
compatibility, explicit approval policy, and the future private Agent Sandbox Runtime seam.

### 34.1 Design lessons adopted from Codex and OpenCode

The design adopts these proven constraints, while avoiding source-level coupling to either project:

- delegate only concrete, bounded work that is independent of the immediate critical path; do not duplicate the same
  work in parent and child, and use explicit ownership when children may write;
- make every child a durable, addressable session/run with a stable parent path, resumable identity, structured result,
  and observable lifecycle rather than an anonymous in-process task;
- treat inherited context as an explicit choice (none, bounded recent context, or a complete frozen snapshot), while
  always injecting applicable system/project policy independently of transcript inheritance;
- attenuate permissions, capabilities, destinations, budgets, model choices, sandbox requirements, and delegation
  depth transitively. A child can never recover authority denied to its parent;
- keep background children observable and collectable without making the parent conversation semantically serial;
  late results, interruption, detach/reattach, and user steering are first-class events;
- execute only genuinely independent ready nodes concurrently, enforce global and per-workflow concurrency/cost limits,
  and merge outputs through one deterministic barrier with explicit retry, cancellation, and stopping rules;
- preserve one clear handoff, acceptance criteria, evidence requirements, and output schema per node; completed work is
  referenced rather than repeated in downstream prompts.

### 34.2 Compatibility target and script contract

The public authoring model follows Claude Code Dynamic Workflows rather than exposing a graph editor or a serialized
DAG. A model writes one plain JavaScript script; the script owns loops, branches, intermediate variables, and fan-out.
The trusted host owns subagent execution, policy, persistence, limits, and side effects. The first statement may be a
statically extractable pure-literal `export const meta = { ... }` with `name`, `description`, optional `whenToUse`, and
optional phase descriptors. The remaining body supports top-level `await` and `return`.

The injected V1 surface is deliberately small:

- `agent(prompt, options?)` starts one isolated child agent and returns text, a schema-validated JSON value, or `null`
  only for an explicitly classified model/provider availability failure; every other failure remains typed and fatal;
- `parallel(thunks)` starts independent thunks concurrently, applies a full barrier, and preserves input result order;
- `pipeline(items, ...stages)` lets each item advance through its stages independently with no global stage barrier;
- `phase(title)` and `log(value)` publish bounded observability events but grant no authority;
- `serialize(value)` converts a JSON-compatible value to bounded JSON handoff text only after checkpointed
  node, depth, collection, and conservative byte-limit validation; raw `JSON.stringify`, array `join`, and other
  non-preemptible amplification APIs remain unavailable;
- `args` is the immutable JSON input supplied at launch;
- `budget.total`, `budget.spent()`, and `budget.remaining()` expose read-only run accounting;
- a saved-workflow call primitive may be enabled only with one-level nesting and a registry-pinned script digest. It
  shares the root run's hard agent/concurrency/token ceilings and cannot widen permissions.

`agent` options are a direct object literal whose only V1 keys are `label`, `phase`, `schema`, `model`, `agentType`,
`isolation`, and `stallMs`. Unknown, computed, shorthand, duplicate, or indirect options fail static analysis before
launch or dispatch. Model substitution is policy-owned and observable. Schema
validation is host-side and receives at most two bounded corrective turns before the call settles to `null`; structural
budget, cancellation, and policy failures remain fatal and are never converted to ordinary data.

Scripts have no direct filesystem, shell, network, model, tool, secret, process, module-loader, clock, random-number,
timer, native-object, or sandbox-provider access. Agents perform all effects through `AgentExecutor`, and every external
operation still crosses `prepare -> authorize -> execute`. Dynamic import, static import, `require`, `eval`, generated
code, WebAssembly, and host-object reflection are rejected. Workflow scripts accept no arbitrary mid-run user input;
only an agent's normal permission request may wait for the user. Sign-off between stages is represented as separate
workflow runs so recovery is unambiguous.

`WorkflowScriptV1` is immutable and content-addressed over normalized UTF-8 source. Saved entries carry a stable logical
ID, an exact conversation/personal owner, and append-only versions; every run pins one exact source digest, every direct
saved-workflow dependency, immutable args, the initiating conversation's
frozen policy/tool/model snapshot, the runtime ABI version, and all effective hard limits. A model-synthesized script is
only a candidate: the host statically analyzes it, extracts metadata, and shows phases and raw source. The user's
explicit `/workflow` command is converted into a non-reusable, digest-bound approval for that exact candidate and the
app starts it immediately; it does not expose redundant Once / Always / Deny launch choices. A crash-recovered candidate
that never reached launch remains inert until Run or Cancel. Script approval never pre-approves agents' external operations.

If the first generated candidate alone fails static analysis, the app may request exactly one size-bounded repair from
the same frozen model/policy context. The rejected source is quoted as untrusted data, the replacement crosses the
entire analyzer and immutable digest-bound launch boundary again, and a second rejection ends candidate preparation.
Repair never executes either source, never manufactures approval, and never widens authority or budgets.

### 34.3 Runtime isolation and replaceable sandbox provider

Workflow script evaluation is behind a versioned `WorkflowScriptRuntimeProvider`; the orchestration, journal, and agent
bridge do not depend on JavaScriptCore or on the future private sandbox implementation. The open-source provider must
advertise its concrete isolation guarantees and limits. A provider that cannot satisfy a run's requirement returns a
typed unsupported/waiting state and never silently downgrades.

The iOS 17 open-source build may use a hardened JavaScriptCore provider for orchestration-only scripts, but it must not
be described as an OS security sandbox. Before evaluation it performs syntax and capability analysis, strips only the
validated leading metadata literal, installs a null host bridge containing only the injected primitives, deep-copies
all values across the realm as bounded canonical JSON, blocks non-deterministic and code-generation globals, instruments
supported loops with cooperative checkpoints, applies source/value/log/phase/step/wall-clock limits, and cancels every
outstanding child when evaluation settles. Scripts that cannot be safely analyzed or instrumented are rejected.

JavaScriptCore on iOS exposes no public hard heap limit or reliable pre-emptive interruption for hostile synchronous or
microtask code. Therefore the open-source provider is gated by a journaled digest-bound approval (derived for one run
from the explicit `/workflow` command) and conservative static rejection. The provider seam must permit the future industrial Agent Sandbox Runtime to supply a truly isolated worker,
hard memory/CPU termination, checkpoint/restore, and richer execution without changing `WorkflowScriptV1`, journals,
run controls, UI projections, or the subagent protocol.

### 34.4 Durable run, exact resume, and scheduler semantics

`WorkflowRun` is event-sourced and binds one script digest and immutable launch snapshot. The append-only log records
launch approval, run controls, phase/log events, every agent's invocation ordinal and rolling identity, child handle,
attempts, structured result or failure, usage, sandbox negotiation, reconciliation, and terminal output. Projections
must be reconstructible from the log alone; large prompts/results remain content-addressed artifacts.

Resume follows Claude Code's started-order prefix rule, not an arbitrary memoization cache. Each agent invocation key is
derived from the previous invocation key plus canonical args, prompt, and output-affecting options. Only the contiguous
prefix whose calls have committed successful results is reusable. The first started-but-uncommitted or identity-mismatched
call and every call after it execute live, even if later calls happened to finish before interruption. Journal `started`
is durable before child submission; result/usage is committed exactly once afterward. Reconciliation writes its exact
call-bound decision intent before sending the idempotent child command. A completed model call followed by an uncertain
journal write enters reconciliation and is never silently re-spent.

One fair dispatch scheduler limits the whole root workflow, including nested saved workflows. `parallel` and `pipeline`
schedule at the agent-dispatch layer so nested fan-out cannot deadlock by holding a permit while waiting for children.
The first release defaults conservatively for iPhone, never exceeds the compatibility hard ceiling of 16 concurrent
agents, caps each `parallel`/`pipeline` input at 4,096, and caps one run at 1,000 agent calls. Configuration values also
have non-overridable hard ceilings. Local decoding continues to obey the single-model resource arbiter; online and
model-free child work may overlap within provider, cost, thermal, memory, and policy limits.

Runs execute in the background relative to the conversation. They are durable, addressable, and independently
observable; only the terminal workflow result is inserted into the parent conversation. Controls are explicit durable
commands: pause stops new dispatches after draining in-flight children, resume reopens dispatch, stop cancels queued and
in-flight work, and restart-agent records a new attempt without rewriting history. App suspension or relaunch detaches
observers rather than implying success or cancellation. Uncertain external effects route to reconciliation.

### 34.5 Parallel subagent, authority, and lifecycle contract

Every `agent()` call becomes a durable `AgentRequest` with a stable workflow path and child identity, a bounded task,
explicit output schema, frozen context-inheritance mode, exact attenuated capability ceiling and tool policy, budget,
model policy, optional sandbox requirement, and evidence/artifact namespace. Children receive applicable system/project
policy independently of transcript inheritance. They never receive the orchestration script's host runtime objects.

Authority, tools, destinations, model choices, budget, sandbox privileges, and delegation depth attenuate transitively.
The workflow inherits the initiating conversation's manually selected tools and cannot enable an unselected tool.
External reads and writes preserve the existing approval policy. Parallel write work requires disjoint declared ownership
or an isolated sandbox/workspace; overlapping unsandboxed write scope is rejected before dispatch. Child progress and
terminal results are append-only and inspectable. Un-awaited children are cancelled and drained when the script settles.

The current staged orchestrator remains a compatibility producer/consumer over the same child execution and recording
primitives. Migration must not change existing workflow IDs, child IDs, message anchors, approvals, or archived summaries;
it is not allowed to distort the Dynamic Workflows script ABI into a static graph.

### 34.6 Generation, saving, rollout, and verification gates

This is one implementation program followed by the single consolidated audit in §29:

1. Freeze the script ABI, metadata/source analyzer, launch snapshot, run events, rolling-prefix journal, child bridge,
   scheduler controls, provider capabilities, and saved-script versioning.
2. Implement static analysis and candidate preview, then the replaceable JavaScript runtime provider and deterministic
   fake provider. No script executes before analysis and launch authorization.
3. Implement the fair dispatch scheduler, `agent` / `parallel` / `pipeline` / `phase` / `log` / `args` / `budget`,
   schema repair, exact prefix resume, cancellation, pause/resume, restart, reconciliation, and crash recovery.
4. Bind calls to durable `AgentExecutor` children, existing approvals/tool selection/model routes/resource arbitration,
   saved scripts, background projections, and the future sandbox requirement seam; do not integrate private code.
5. Add the model-facing workflow-generation tool/prompt and launch-preview flow without creating a second chat UI.
6. Complete simulator, macOS, and physical-device evidence, then perform the one consolidated audit.

P0 verification must include metadata/parser and forbidden-capability corpora; randomized canonical args/options and
rolling-key properties; JavaScript realm-escape probes; sync/async runaway, huge source/value/log, cancellation, timeout,
and outstanding-child cleanup tests; exact sequential/parallel/pipeline ordering; nested fan-out at concurrency one;
schema repair/exhaustion; fatal-vs-null error classification; all 1,000/4,096/concurrency/budget hard limits; rotating-seed
fairness/deadlock/starvation tests; every started/result/checkpoint crash boundary; longest-prefix replay and changed-args/
prompt/options invalidation; pause/resume/stop/restart/relaunch; authority/tool/budget/depth attenuation; approval digest
binding; uncertain-effect reconciliation; saved-version migration; staged-workflow compatibility; accessibility; long-run
resource/leak tests; and matched local/online performance baselines. Test source must materially exceed happy-path coverage,
and no Dynamic Workflows requirement becomes release-green from a scripted demonstration alone.

### 34.7 Complex-goal exploratory evaluation

Deterministic runtime and UI fixtures prove mechanics, not whether a real model produces a useful workflow or answer.
Nightly and release-candidate evaluation therefore runs an online model through the same app UI, candidate analyzer,
durable engine, child executor, selected-tool policy, approvals, and final chat projection used by a person. The initial
matrix covers at least five materially different problem shapes: current-fact feasibility research with a strict local-vs-
cloud distinction, multi-constraint planning with fallbacks, architecture and security tradeoffs, crash-boundary incident
analysis, and an untrusted-goal/prompt-injection boundary. `/workflow` is exercised at both the beginning and end of the
message. A parameterized ad-hoc probe must accept newly reported complex goals without requiring a new test harness.

An exploratory run passes only when the candidate reaches execution, independent work is genuinely decomposed (and uses
parallel fan-out when requested), the durable projection exposes the expected child calls, the run completes, and the
actual final assistant answer satisfies scenario-specific semantic oracles. For example, a request about installing the
complete Kimi K3 weights on an iPhone 16 Pro must answer that exact local/offline question; substituting an official app or
cloud API is not success. Exact JavaScript source, projected child status/details, terminal state, final answer, diagnostic
failures, and a screenshot are retained in the xcresult. Candidate-analysis, runtime, approval, budget, reconciliation,
missing-answer, or semantic-quality failures remain visible test failures rather than being converted into demonstrations.

Live-model results are intentionally nondeterministic evidence and never replace deterministic gates. Provider drift is
handled with repeated evidence or an explicit time-bounded quarantine, not by weakening semantic assertions. Simulator
coverage is the fast path for online workflows; physical-device evidence remains required for release claims involving
local models, device resources, suspension, or hardware-specific behavior.
