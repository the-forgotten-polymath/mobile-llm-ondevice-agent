/// Guarantees:
///   • **Versioned Codable manifest** under Application Support (or any injected URL, for tests).
///   • **Atomic writes** (write a sibling `.tmp` → rename over the destination) so a crash mid-write
///     never leaves a half-written manifest.
///   • **Corrupt manifest → back-up-not-wipe**: an unreadable manifest is moved aside to
///     `<name>.corrupt` (never deleted), and load returns empty rather than crashing — the data is
///     preserved for forensic/manual recovery, and the next `save` rebuilds a clean file.
///   • **Bad-record skipping**: within a readable manifest, records that fail to decode are dropped
///     individually instead of failing the whole load.
