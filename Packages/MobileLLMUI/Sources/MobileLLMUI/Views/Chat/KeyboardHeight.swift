// The FlowDown primitive, verbatim in spirit: its SafeInputView pins the input bar's bottom to
// `keyboardLayoutGuide.top` and never touches keyboard notifications. Notifications proved exactly as
// unreliable here as their reputation — the photo sheet's present/dismiss storm left the observed height
// stuck high with no keyboard and reset it to zero with the keyboard up. The layout guide has no such
// races: UIKit itself keeps a tracking view pinned between the guide's top and the window bottom, and
// its measured height IS the ground truth (bottom safe-area inset when hidden, keyboard height when up),
// updated frame-by-frame through the keyboard animation and interactive dismissal.

/// its bottom value even while its avoidance does nothing, so subtracting THAT zeroed the lift — the
