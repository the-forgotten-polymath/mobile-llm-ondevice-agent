// MobileLLMUI — the product UI layer for mobileLLM: the SwiftUI chat surface, model manager, and
// settings, plus the @Observable stores that drive them. MLX-FREE: it codes against the
// `LLMCore.LLMEngine` protocol and is exercised by `LLMCore.MockLLMEngine` in previews + tests, so
// the real fork-linked MLX engine injects at app-assembly time. Builds + tests with the plain SwiftPM
// CLI (no Metal toolchain).
